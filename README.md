# Differential Drive Mobile Robot
## Modelling
A detailed summary of the modelling of the robot is reported in the [repot file](https://github.com/asarmadi/Differential_Drive_Mobile_Robot/blob/main/report.pdf). The matrial of the report are mostly taken from [Dynamic Modelling of Differential-Drive Mobile Robots using Lagrange and Newton-Euler Methodologies: A Unified Framework](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/dynamic-modelling-of-differentialdrive-mobile-robots-using-lagrange-and-newtoneuler-methodologies-a-unified-framework-2168-9695.1000107.pdf)
