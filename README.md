# Differential Drive Mobile Robot
## Modelling
A detailed summary of the modelling of the robot is reported in the [report file](https://github.com/asarmadi/Differential_Drive_Mobile_Robot/blob/main/Docs/report.pdf). The matrial of the report are mostly taken from [Dynamic Modelling of Differential-Drive Mobile Robots using Lagrange and Newton-Euler Methodologies: A Unified Framework](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/dynamic-modelling-of-differentialdrive-mobile-robots-using-lagrange-and-newtoneuler-methodologies-a-unified-framework-2168-9695.1000107.pdf)

## Simulation
The parameters for the simulation are derived form the [Dynamics modeling and sliding mode control of tractor-trailer wheeled mobile robots subject to wheels slip](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X18319062)

## Control
The follwing controllers are implemented:
